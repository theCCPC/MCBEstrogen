# MCBEstrogen


HRT has **OFFICIALLY** come to Minecraft!

***⚠️IMPORTANT NOTICE⚠️:*** When playing with this addon you need to enable Experimental Features when creating the world. Specifically **Hoiday Creator Features** and **Custom Biomes**

Visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/theCCPC/MCBEstrogen/releases) to download the latest .mcaddon file, or clone the repository and do it your own way.

### But wait- 

#### You may be asking, *"how do I get my HRT?"* And it's simple really:

1. Find estrogen ore naturally generating in the world between y=0 -> y=32
2. Craft the raw mineral into Estrogen Powder at a crafting table
3. Gather the powerful materials required for the Estrogen Pill
4. And Finally, craft yourself the girl pill. It's easy as that.

### Happy Transing!!

To-Do:
- get better textures
- estrogen potion?
- estrogen tools & maybe armor
- more interesting Girl Power effect
